Code401 Midterm Project


### Members

* Lulu Sevignon
* Alex Whan
* Joshua Beasley
* Stephen Baldock

### Project Proposal

* The Seattle JavaScript Innovators (pending name change) have yet to settle upon a project. This 
  document will be updated with more current information no later than Friday, September 4

### PM Tools

* Trello will act as the team project management hub to maintain 
  organization of daily tasks, measure progress toward MVP, and 
  document individual work loads
    * [Trello](https://trello.com/b/p7RLAdR7/team-beasley)
    
* GitHub will server as a central repository for all working code and completed steps
    
### Conflict Plan

* Applicable Scenarios:
    * Team member refusing to participate
    * Team member minimizing other team member contributions
    * Team member communicating in a rude or inappropriate way
    * Argument between two or more team members
    
* Solutions:
    * Open communication and be up front if you’re struggling or having trouble with something
    * If it feels like someone is not pulling their weight, have a stand up or group discussion to assess the situation and what everyone is working on (and has         worked on so far)
    * Commit to fixing the situation moving forward
    * Possible redistribution of working moving forward, etc
    * Two people getting into a real argument/emotions running high (people disagreeing on how to build a feature, etc):
    * Everyone take a break for a few minutes to collect their thoughts
    * Ask others in the group to listen and mediate, and if that’s not possible, go to JB or the TAs as an outside perspective
    * Helpful mindset in terms of approaching other teammates with constructive criticism and productive solutions for fixing processes moving forward

### Communication Plan

* Primary communication tools: Remo & Slack
    * Zoom to act as backup if Remo experiences functionality issues
    * Zoom to provide additional pair-programming platform due to superior screen
* Phone numbers as last resort/backup
* Working hours: 9:00am-6:00pm, Monday-Friday
* Daily Team standup (separate from standup with JB) at 9am
    * Mention features you are working on after hours, so there’s less chance of a merge contract
    * Standup meetings are a good place for everyone to communicate issues they may be having, topics they would like to address, and generally making sure that         everyone is feeling safe creatively and psychologically Check in with everyone regarding their working plans for the day, can organize pair programming as         needed
